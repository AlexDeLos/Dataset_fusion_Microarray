Although roots are the primary targets of salt stress, the signaling networks that facilitate metabolic reprogramming to induce stress tolerance are less understood than those in leaves. Here, a combination of transcriptomic and metabolic approaches was performed in salt-treated Arabidopsis thaliana roots, which revealed that the group S1 basic leucine zipper transcription factors bZIP1 and bZIP53 reprogram primary C- and N-metabolism. In particular, gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism are affected by these transcription factors. Importantly, bZIP1 expression reflects cellular stress and energy status in roots. In addition to the well-described abiotic stress response pathway initiated by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and executed by SnRK2 (Snf1-RELATED-PROTEIN-KINASE2) and AREB-like bZIP factors, we identify a structurally related ABA-independent signaling module consisting of SnRK1s and S1 bZIPs. Crosstalk between these signaling pathways recruits particular bZIP factor combinations to establish at least four distinct gene expression patterns. Understanding this signaling network provides a framework for securing future crop productivity.'],

In this study, a reverse genetic approach was taken to elucidate the role of Arabidopsis Til1 (At5g58070) in thermotolerance.  We showed that Til1 proteins was constitutively expressed and increased significantly after heat shock treatment.  A T-DNA knockout line of Til1, designated as til1-1, could not produce Til1 and showed severe defects in basal and acquired thermotolerance.  Introducing a wild type copy of Til1 gene into til1-1 complemented the mutant phenotype.  Over-expression of Til1 in the wild type plant did not enhance thermotolerance.  Til1 is peripherally associated with plasma membrane, suggesting a regulatory or protective role of this protein in membrane function.  Transcriptomic analysis showed that the heat shock response in til1-1 was not altered as compared to the wild type plants.  The temperature threshold for heat shock protein induction was not affected by the level of Til1.  Ion leakage analysis revealed no significant difference in membrane stability between the wild type and til1-1 seedlings.  These results suggested that Til1 is not involved in regulating membrane fluidity or stability.  Nevertheless, the level of malondialdehyde was significantly higher in til1-1 than in the wild type after severe heat treatment.  The mutant plants were also more sensitive than the wild type to tert-butyl hydroperoxide, a reagent that induces lipid peroxidation.  Taken together, our data indicate that Til1 is an essential component for thermotolerance probably by acting against lipid peroxidation induced by severe heat stress.'],
